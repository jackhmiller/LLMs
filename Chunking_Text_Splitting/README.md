## Structured Text Splitting and Metadata-enhanced RAG

Not altogether unlike the way human readers interact with natural language, AI applications that rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) must balance the analytic precision of drawing inferences from short sequences of characters (what your English teacher would call "close reading") against the comprehension of context-bound structures of meaning that emerge more or less continuously as those sequences increase in length (what your particularly cool English teacher would call "distant reading").

This project explores a novel approach to striking this balance with HTML content, leveraging important contextual information inherent to document structures that is typically lost when LLM applications are built over web-scraped data or other HTML sources
